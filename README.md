 These values should match the values in the Maslow4 Router core replacment molecule referenced in this model. 

**Value:** __GEOMETRY_INPUT__

This is a pen holder that would replace the bottom two layers of the wooden router core replacement cylinder. Two pieces of rubber sheet (inner tube) can be cut to the dimensions of the top disk (which is not in the final assembly and then clamped between the thin circles and the main body of the pen holder. Pen or pencil can be inserted in the two middle holes in the rubber.
